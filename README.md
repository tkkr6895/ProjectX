ProjectX
========
An android application which hopes to solve the parking space availability issue (Currently focusing primarily in bangalore.)
The application will work on a crowd sourced basis, wherein the GPS coordinates of a space is stored onto the database.
The space availability will work on a two fold basis:
1. The distance of the user from the parking spot.
2. The priority status of the user, which is earned by using the application regularly.

This would also include social media integration and Local services availability around the space.

A project incorporated by students of PES University, Bangalore.
